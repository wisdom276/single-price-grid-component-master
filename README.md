# Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component

![Design preview for the Single price grid component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is a very nice project designed to improve my css and html skills. 
In this project I have learnt list style, border style, media query, and how to view my web app on different devices.
A million thanks to Frontend Mentor.
